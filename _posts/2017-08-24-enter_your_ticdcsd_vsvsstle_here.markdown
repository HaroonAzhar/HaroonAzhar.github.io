Hey-yo, Hope you're having a great day. I recently finished my OO ruby porfolio project. The project is a gem(ruby library) that fetches quotes from the [good reads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes) website, it's seems not like a very resourceful gem at first sight but....It's not a gem you need; but a one you deserve *in batman voice* . I created this gem because I want people to conjoin aspirations into their apllications(most good web apps like Bussiness Insider and forbes website have a quote of a day). 

There aren't many libraries for getting quotes, so I thought I'd make one as my portfolio project (*--*).

The gem isn't just a library but it's comes with a fandy(fancy and handy) feature: a cli interface.Just head over to [my demo of the Quote Box gem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zV0mEUE8DY&t=7s),to learn how to use the gem.

You can also get the soure code from the my github project [repo](https://github.com/HaroonAzhar/quote-box-cli-app)
